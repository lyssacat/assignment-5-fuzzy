            In 1994, Belinda Asher was well known in her small Lexington neighborhood for baking wonderfully creative treats for her friends and family. Her former neighbor Frank Cramer says you could always smell something baking from her open kitchen window. Later that year, Belinda took the first step into making what is today Fuzzy’s by baking and selling pastries out of her home. After finding major success in her new business, Belinda purchased a small storefront just a few streets over from her home and began serving the neighborhood from what we now know as Fuzzy’s Bakery and Café.<br>

            Fuzzy, our namesake, was Belinda’s beloved feline companion who was often seen dozing on a pillow in the shop’s window. Fuzzy unfortunately departed this world in 2009, but a photo of him remains next to the display case at the counter. In the present day, Belinda’s newest cat, Mindy, now acts as our door greeter.<br>
